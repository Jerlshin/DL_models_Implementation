# Deep Learning Models Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various deep learning architectures using PyTorch from scratch. Each subdirectory represents a different deep learning model, and you can find detailed information and usage instructions within each model's directory.

## Table of Contents

- [Models](#models)
  - [EfficientNet](./EfficientNet/): Implementation of the EfficientNet architecture.
  - [InceptionNet (GoogLeNet)](./InceptionNet_GoogLeNet/): Implementation of the InceptionNet (GoogLeNet) architecture.
  - [LeNet](./LeNet/): Implementation of the LeNet architecture.
  - [ResNet](./ResNet/): Implementation of the ResNet architecture.
  - [Transformers](./Transformers/): Implementation of various transformer models.
  - [VGG-16](./VGG-16/): Implementation of the VGG-16 architecture.
  - [YOLOvX](./YOLO%20v_x%20Implementation/): Implementation of YOLO (You Only Look Once) versions.

## Usage

Each model directory contains its own README file with specific instructions on how to use and train the model. Make sure to refer to the respective README files for details on each model.

## Getting Started
